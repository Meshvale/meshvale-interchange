# meshvale-interchange

Asset import and export for polygon mesh workflows.

**Status:** Development native library with an OBJ/MTL text adapter. No stable release, automatic resource loading, CLI or Python package yet.

## Available native adapter

Import/export mixed polygon faces with separate corner UVs/normals, missingness, material assignments, object/group membership and smoothing. Export reloads and verifies its result before returning text. Extra UV sets and other unsupported channels produce an explicit failure; OBJ is an initial adapter, and the wider format plan remains below.

Read the [OBJ/MTL contract](docs/obj.md) for the supported subset and numerical/preservation limits. The [installed consumer](examples/consumer/main.cpp) demonstrates the interface. Supplied MTL bytes are retained; texture/resource files are not automatically loaded or verified.

## Planned capabilities

- Polygon face and attribute preservation where a format supports it.
- Scene, material, instance, and resource handling with stated coverage.
- Explicit reports for triangulation, unsupported features, and conversion loss.
- Candidate formats: OBJ/MTL, PLY, OFF, STL, and glTF/GLB.
- FBX, 3MF, and USD integrations remain under evaluation.

Supported formats, operation guarantees, and platform compatibility will be documented and tested with each implementation and release.

## Development

Read [ENVIRONMENT.md](ENVIRONMENT.md) for portable build/install instructions and checks, [THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md) for dependencies, and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for consumer-facing changes. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) provides focused contributor instructions. The installed CMake target is `meshvale::interchange`.
